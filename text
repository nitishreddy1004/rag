Consider I want to, I have built a web application and when I search for some information, it should actually pull from the docs which are in my Google Drive and also it should use some, it should use RAG to pull some external information. So what happened is, so when I, you know, put a question, it need to go to the document which is under Google Docs, but I was not able to do that. So what did it is, I just put it under a folder, I put a single document and when I ask a question, it retrieves, if the question is related to that document, it retrieves the information and gives me the answer and it also uses RAG to put, to give, to get some external context. So I want my web application to use a Google Drive where I store some thousands of documents and when I ask a question, for example, what is the zoning code of Kansas City, so the document, it should go to the Google Drive and search for the Kansas City document and pull out the information and also use the RAG to get the general information around the internet and give the answers.
